# DNSWanIP
DNSWanIP was created to fill a simple problem:
How do I share my website on my home server when I have an ISP that charges waaayyy too much for a static (business) IP address?

I didn't want to pay for hosting and I didn't want to pay for NoIP or a similar service, all thought it is cheap to do that.
This was more an excersize to see if I could figure out a way to do this on my own.

The solution that I cam up with is many fold and this program is the end user part of that solution.
Basically the setup is to use Dropbox to sync your IP address every 15 minutes and use this end user program as a one
click hyperlink to take individuals to your site.
